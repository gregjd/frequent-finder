I chose Spokane as a sample data set because they have a [really great system map](https://www.spokanetransit.com/files/content/SPO_MaG_system_WEB_2014.pdf) with frequent service highlighted. Besides being [great on its own](http://www.humantransit.org/2011/09/an-exceptionally-clear-network-map.html), this map is also really great because I can use it as a comparison. Given Spokane's GTFS data, frequent-finder should be able to produce something that looks vaguely similar, at least in terms of which lines are classified as frequent.
